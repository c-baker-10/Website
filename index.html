        <h1> Welcome to my webpage </h1>

        <h5>About me</h5>
        <p>The biggest drive for me every day is the knowledge that every day I can better myself in some way. 
            I swam competitively until my sophomore year of college, which gave me the opportunity to better myself physically every day. 
            I started working seasonally when I was 15 years old to better myself in a professional setting. 
            I am currently pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics, where I learn new things and develop my understanding daily. 
            Through these experiences, I am able to better my communication and personal skills.
